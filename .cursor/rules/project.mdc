# Project description

- The project is known as PlaygroundMap in English and Leikkipuistokartta in Finnish.
- The project is an interactive playground map for tracking visited playgrounds nearby, rating the playgrounds and sharing the ratings.
- The project is implemented in React, Chakra UI v3, Leaflet.
- The backend is supabase.
- Always use Chakra UI V3 components.
- Never use @chakra-ui/icons since it has been removed in V3 and will NOT work.
- Be hesitant to edit src/components/ui/switch.tsx or src/components/ui/toaster.tsx. These are snippets generated with Chakra UI CLI and you do not have the skills to make them better.
