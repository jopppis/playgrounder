# How to do your work

- After changing something, add CHANGELOG.md entry.
- When adding features, add also tests for the feature
- When fixing bugs, add a test for the bug
- When adding tests, run the tests with `npm test`. It might be better to filter to only the new test file.
- When adding translations always add them to @fi.json and @en.json.
- When changing something that might break the build run `npm run build` to check if the build is successful.
- For single command verification run `npm run lint && npm test && npm run build`
- When adding tests, do not hardcode translations but instead use the enTranslations object like in @playgroundPopup.test.tsx
- When changing filters in @PlaygroundFilter.tsx make sure to also propagate the filter to @Stats.tsx
